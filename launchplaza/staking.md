# Staking

To help projects launch, DefiPlaza is offering Staking-as-a-Service free of charge to projects that have a liquidity pool on DefiPlaza. A [small fee is charged](staking.md#pricing) when adding or removing stake or depositing rewards to the staking component.

To set up staking for your token we need to create the staking component first and then connect it to your token. We will also help you set up the right metadata so it shows up in the wallet's transaction preview as part of your project.

We even offer an easy to use widget that you can include in your website, with a few themes to integrate it as nicely as possible.

Pricing

### Pricing and fees

DefiPlaza does not charge a recurring subsscription fee to use the Staking feature of Launchplaza, but has added small royalty fees to (un)staking and de\[ositing rewards.

#### Add stake / Unstake

Every time a user stakes or unstakes it's token, a $0,10 royalty fee is charged to the user in XRD. This is paid as part of the transaction fee.

#### Deposit rewards

When staking rewards are deposited into the contract a $0,50 royalty fee is charged in XRD. This is paid as part of the transaction fee.
