# Welcome to DefiPlaza

DefiPlaza offers trades between tokens by functioning as an Automated Market Maker (AMM) like other exchanges.

What makes DefiPlaza special are _single-contract_, _highly optimized DEXs_, designed to offer the lowest possible trade cost to the end user. Gas costs per trade are the lowest in the industry, and thanks to the multi-token setup, they are very capital efficient, while Impermanent Loss is minimized.

We currently have **two multi-token pools on Ethereum**, focusing on blue chip and stable tokens. We automatically select the pool with the lowest trade fee for each trade.

On **Radix** DefiPlaza built a DEX specifically designed to reduce the risk of Impermanent Loss and help make DeFi sustainably profitable.
