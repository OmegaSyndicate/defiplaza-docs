\[explain how to swap]

### Fees

A transaction fee of `0.15%` is charged for each swap from or to DFP2. A swap that does not include DFP2 is internally managed as a hop over two pairs; thus, `0.3%` is charged. This transaction fee is for the LP providers.

On top of the transaction fee, a fixed fee of 0,05 `USD` is charged for each swap from or to DFP2. A swap that does not include DFP2 is internally managed as a hop over two pairs; thus, `0,1 USD` is charged. This fixed fee is for the DefiPlaza DAO to cover running the operational cost.
