# Overview

RadixPlaza is a DEX specifically designed to reduce the risk of Impermanent Loss and help make DeFi sustainably profitable.

Where MultiPlaza and StablePlaza on Ethereum have fixed sets of tokens controlled by the DefiPlaza DAO, on RadixPlaza, everybody can create new pairs. The DefiPlaza DAO may delist token pairs that are potentially harming the RadixPlaza DEX.
