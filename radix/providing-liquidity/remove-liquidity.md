# Remove Liquidity

Removing your liquidity on RadixPlaza can be done by sending in a part or all of your LP tokens. Although providing liquidity is single-sided, it can occur that you get both tokens in return when the pair is currently not in equilibrium. This is done to ensure you get the fairest amount of tokens back.

IN a future update of the Radix Wallet, it will be possible to redeem your LP tokens straight from the Pool Units overview.
