# Add Liquidity

To add liquidity to DefiPlaza, pick a pair from the pair overview. If the pair does not exist, you can [create a new pair](create-new-pair.md).

Adding liquidity to a pair is single-sided. This means you can choose to either provide the base token or DFP2. There is no requirement to add both.

After you provide liquidity, the LP Tokens can be found in the Radix Wallet under Pool Units.

Although DefiPlaza strives to minimize IL, there is no guarantee that IL does not occur. Please do your own research and understand the risks of IL before providing liquidity to any DEX.
