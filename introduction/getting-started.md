# Getting started

There are currently 3 DEXes active: MultiPlaza, StablePlaza and RadixPlaza

### MultiPlaza

The MultiPlaza pool on Ethereum is a 16-token pool of blue chip tokens and is 15 times more capital efficient than traditional pair-based DEXs, offering up to 15 times more fees per unit of liquidity at the same trading volume.

### StablePlaza&#x20;

The StablePlaza pool on Ethereum is a 4-token pool of stable tokens and takes the same highly optimized approach as the DefiPlaza pool to provide cheaper trades, with an even lower transaction fee of 0.03% of the value traded. Thanks to the stablecoins, Impermanent Loss is minimized.

### RadixPlaza

RadixPlaza recently launched on Radix, focusing on minimizing the Impermant Loss risk.
